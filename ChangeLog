	fsoaudiod: fix silent calls on the GTA04 side.
	Without that fix, under the SHR distribution the GTA04 phone
	  received a call, then it rang, and then the gta04 side didn't
	  ear the remote while the remote could ear the person with the
	  GTA04.

	That was because the GTA04 alsaloop forwarder configuration
	  was using the sound card directly, without the multiplexing
	  (such as dmix or dsnoop), and so that failed because the ring process
	  was already using the sound card.

	The correct fix is to use the "default" device which, under SHR, handles
	  multiplxing for playback and recording correctly(the ring process is
	  already using the "default" device).

	Note that using the default device has a performance cost( higher
	  CPU usage).

	fsoaudiod: alsaloop gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder plugin: fix high CPU usage before call.
	Thanks a lot DocScrutinizer05 on #openmoko-cdevel FreeNode IRC Channel:
	  Jun 04 23:26:42 <gnutoo>        there is a call incomming or outgoing
	  Jun 04 23:26:48 <gnutoo>        fsogsmd knows it
	  Jun 04 23:26:57 <gnutoo>        so it tells it on dbus
	  Jun 04 23:27:06 <gnutoo>        fsoaudiod which is listenning on dbug get that message
	  Jun 04 23:27:15 <gnutoo>        and activate the alsaloop based plugin
	  Jun 04 23:27:17 <gnutoo>        however....
	  [...]
	  #Jun 04 23:27:17 *       backb0ne__ (~backb0ne@27.Red-88-26-71.staticIP.rima-tde.net) has joined #openmoko-cdevel
	  Jun 04 23:27:28 <gnutoo>        there is a time between that activation and when the modem is ready
	  Jun 04 23:27:39 <gnutoo>        because the modem is the one who is clock master
	  Jun 04 23:27:53 <DocScrutinizer05>      ouch
	  Jun 04 23:27:57 <gnutoo>        so then what happens in alsaloop is that poll() returns too fast
	  Jun 04 23:28:18 <DocScrutinizer05>      instantly with -EAGAIN I guess
	  Jun 04 23:28:48 <gnutoo>        like the asoc poll() is broken for our case where the clocks master are from the modem
	  Jun 04 23:29:05 <DocScrutinizer05>      in which case alsaloop SHOULD call a usleep(1000)
	  Jun 04 23:29:35 <gnutoo>        that poll() returning too fast (30us) instead of 30000000us or something big like that causes the 100% CPU usage
	  Jun 04 23:29:51 <gnutoo>        and then the 100% CPU usage causes other problem once the modem is started
	  Jun 04 23:29:55 <gnutoo>        because it doesn't sotp
	  Jun 04 23:29:57 <gnutoo>        *stop
	  [...]
	  Jun 04 23:30:00 <DocScrutinizer05>      yep, that's why alsaloop needs a usleep()
	  [...]
	  Jun 04 23:33:21 <DocScrutinizer05>      not if you put it at the right location
	  Jun 04 23:33:31 <DocScrutinizer05>      immediately *before* the poll()

	fsoaudiod: configure.ac: add configurable libsamplerate dependency
	This is needed because the GTA04 audio forwarding plugin
	  depends on libsamplerate.

	Thanks to lindi on #openmoko-cdevel on the Freenode IRC servers:
	  Jan 25 18:53:50 <lindi-_>	GNUtoo: perhaps PKG_CHECK_MODULES(LIBSAMPLERATE, [libsamplerate]) in configure.in

	fsoaudiod: conf: gta04: update alsaloop.conf
	This new version add record capability and less CPU usage and latency

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: fix CPU usage
	Without that fix the CPU usage is high on the GTA04 machine because at
	  FreeSmartphone.GSM.CallStatus.OUTGOING, the modem "sound card"
	  is not ready yet, which causes buffer underruns/overruns issues
	  which causes high CPU usage, which unfortunately stays accross
	  the whole call.

2012-01-25  Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli  <GNUtoo@no-log.org>

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: make succesive calls work.
	Without that fix alsaloop exited right after starting after
	  the first call: that was caused by the global quit variable:
	  it was set to one after the first call to make alsaloop exit,
	  but it stayed one on the successive calls because it was initialized
	  only when alsaloop started for the first time.

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: alsaloop.c: switch from exit to return
	without that the exit code could make fsoaudiod exit instead of just the forwarder.

	  Jan 14 13:40:23 <mrmoku>	GNUtoo: make those too a return and check for the value?

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: fix restart when thread exits by itself
	Thanks to mrmoku on #openmoko-cdevel Freenode irc channel for noticing it:
	  Jan 14 13:26:40 <mrmoku>	GNUtoo: one suboptimal thing is... when start_forwarder exits by itself (without calling stop) alsaLoopThread won't be reset to null

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: add mutex to protect threads and add more logging

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: make alsaloop exit without exiting fsoaudiod
	Without that fix fsoaudiod quits when alsaloop exits

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_forwarder: better handling of the start/stop of the wrapper alsaloop
	Note that when the call stops fsoaudiod exits...
	That will be addressed in a new commit.

	fsoaudiod: gsmvoice_alsa_cmtspeechdata plugin: try to handle buffer underruns in the buffers
	We have 2 pointers, a read pointer and a write pointers.
	  we can treat it like 2 buffers in the big buffers:
	  so we have a read buffer and a write buffer.
	  the length of both virtual buffer are 320 bytes.
	  Since alsa writei was faster than the modem, it tried to writei more than necessary
	  And the read buffer passed before the write buffer in the FIFO big buffer.
	  That is now beeing handled

	At some pointt there was a comparison of the pointers distance, that didn't take in account the fact
	  that a distance is always positive(for instance when a buffer cross the border and the other buffer
	  didn't cross it yet. that is also now handled.
