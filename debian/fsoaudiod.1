.SH NAME
fsoaudiod \- FSO audiod daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fsoaudiod
.SH DESCRIPTION
fsoaudiod implements the FSO Audio DBus API. This API delivers a simple way to
handle audio scenarios. More precisely it handles the following things:

* Manage audio modes
.br
* Manage audio devices
.br
* Organize (stack) audio scenarios
.br
* Manage volume

fsoaudiod loads its configuration from
/etc/freesmartphone/conf/<platform>/fsoaudiod.conf (platform is detected
via /proc/cpuinfo). If this file can't be found it will fallback to
/etc/freesmartphone/conf/default/fsoaudiod.conf instead.

The daemon will be started automatically by DBus, once a request is send
to it, but can also be started manually.
.SH OPTIONS
fsoaudiod takes no parameters.
